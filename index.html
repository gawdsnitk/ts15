						In the digital era where even a 4 year old knows how to operate a mobile phone, use of electricity has become paramount. But a whopping 1.4 billion people remain deprived of the light that we happily leave turned on when not in use. We fail to realize that today’s ignorance can lead to darkness of tomorrow and a moment’s joy can cause unprecedented sorrow. Let us pledge to try our best to remain inspired to save electricity and turn off those hot switches for a bright future. <br>

						Only two out of 1609 cities in India get continuous water supply which is remorsefully low to even mention as a fact. If this world is a body then water is the blood that supports it. Water, the elixir of life, has the power to create and destroy too, and thus it must not be wasted and judiciously used. Let us strive not to convert grasslands of today into deserts of tomorrow. <br>
						
						This Techspardha we are determined to bring a change by inculcating a seed of awareness among people to save water and electricity. And we aim to achieve this with the help of ROOH, our social initiative partner. <a href="http://www.rooh.org.in" target="_blank">ROOH</a> is a social society of NIT Kurukshetra which strives for social upliftment and development of society on the grounds of public responsibility. <br>
